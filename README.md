This is my program for using google translate "picture capture" on the computer.

It has basically the same functionality as phone version of google translate, which can take pictures (using the phones camera) and translate them.

My program takes screenshots and translates them to the target language.

It only supports Japanese to English right now, but can be modified freely to work with any language.

Refer to the manual for installation and usage instructions.
